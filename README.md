# ODE

TODO
1. how to define init value for gene data, variance?
2. how to define the max iter, n and R in generate trajectories?
3. need explain the last module in cost function(Guo's: suppose different states would appear in the same possibility. 
The last part need to increase or remove).
4. hill coefficient need special definition
5. need some trick to deal inf or nan(add random number for example).
